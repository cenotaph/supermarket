  %h2= "Supermarket #{@performanceapplication.year.year} Performance Programme: Application"

  -#  %h4 Applications are closed
  -#  %p Applications for the Red Spot performance programme are now closed. Thank you for your interest. We will announce the programme closer to the opening of Supermarket 2016.

  %p  Please note that we cannot offer financial support for the Performance programme. The exhibitors at Supermarket pay a participation fee; there is no fee to perform but you must be self-financed. We can provide a letter of invitation to support your external funding applications.
  %p Please note that we offer basic technical support (basic set of loudspeakers, basic microphones, basic sound mixer, a projector, spotlights, table and chairs) and assistance of our volunteers, but we do not provide a technician on the stage. Performances with less technical demands are preferred. If you have any specific technical requirements, you need to be able to manage them yourself/provide your technician/be able to explain them to our volunteers.
